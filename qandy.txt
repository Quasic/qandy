Qandy Pocket Computer
System Overview



The qandy.htm file is the computer's BIOS that gets
executed when powered on. It loads a series of "hardware"
scripts:


video.js is the video driver that handles the text screen
operations. It translates a "retro screen" into a 
"JavaScript" DOM. The programmer does not need to access
the DOM to use the text screen, but instead should use
the built-in library of PEEK and POKE functions. It
features an ANSI engine for changing colors and drawing
graphics. 

gfx.js is the graphics card, like "DirectX" was to Windows
this is a 2d-X engine that has functions to display the
Queville tileset, characters, and items and features
the classic Queville "popup".

keyboard.js is the keyboard controller, it displays the
virtual keyboard and intercepts keystrokes from any
physical keyboard attached and handles user input and the
cursor controls. Future plans are to build a "mouse.js"
to work in conjunction with the keyboard. 

dos.js will be the disk operating system that interfaces
with external devices starting with LOCAL for
localStorage in the user's web browser. When a server
is written, it will be able to interact with the server
via the "COOKIE" device, which I might even call "MODEM".
